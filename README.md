# BikeFree

Mountian Biking clone of [SkiFree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/).

## Features so far:

* Biking down a never-ending mountian with randomly-generated trees which do not have transparent backgrounds
* Collision detection with trees - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Stopping
* BIGFEET! They even eat you and then run away because they're full
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone, you absolute badass
* Speed boost (this was a little-known feature to get away from bigfeet) using the F key
* **MOBILE SUPPORT**  Try loading the on a mobile device and then use your finger to direct the skier around the piste. Also try double-tap ;)
* Rainbow jump platforms & jumping - though a couple of improvements could be made
* LocalStorage high-score (thanks, [@ddoolin](https://github.com/ddoolin)!)
* Custom-sized Hitboxes
* Big trees & crashing into them both whilst biking and jumping
